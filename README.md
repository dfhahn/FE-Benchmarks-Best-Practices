# Best Practices for Alchemical Free Energy Simulations

## Goals

- Guidelines for selecting good experimental datasets for retrospective and prospective benchmarks (benchmarking real-world performance) so that we might be able to get a good idea of prospective accuracy or identify challenges that remain to be solved
- Guidelines for setting up simulations for binding free energy calculations, ideally broad enough so that we can share systems that could be used for relative, absolute, endpoint, and ML approaches (with special emphasis on relative)
- Guidelines for statistical analysis of the resulting predictions, drawing conclusions about relative performance, and identifying systematic issues (with special emphasis on relative, though applicable to D3R/SAMPL as well)
