          , 
            
              Ligand binding affinity calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and non-physical (alchemical) thermodynamic cycles have shown great promise for structure-based drug design. However, their broad uptake and impact is held back by the notoriously complex setup of the calculations. Only a few tools other than the free energy perturbation approach by Schr\"odinger Inc. (referred to as FEP+) currently enable end-to-end application. Here, we present for the first time an approach based on the open-source software pmx that allows to easily set up and run alchemical calculations for diverse sets of small molecules using the GROMACS MD engine. The method relies on theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (TI) foundations, and its flexibility allows calculations with multiple force fields. In this study, results from the Amber and Charmm force fields were combined to yield a consensus outcome performing on par with the commercial FEP+ approach. A large dataset of 482 perturbations from 13 different protein\textendash ligand datasets led to an average unsigned error (AUE) of 3.64 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol
              -1
              , equivalent to Schr\"odinger's FEP+ AUE of 3.66 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol
              -1
              . For the first time, a setup is presented for overall high precision and high accuracy relative protein\textendash ligand alchemical free energy calculations based on open-source software.},

          , 
            The capability to rank different potential drug molecules against a protein target for potency has always been a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry due to its importance in drug design. While several simulation-based methodologies exist, they are hard to use prospectively and thus predicting potency in lead optimization campaigns remains an open challenge. Here we present the first machine learning approach specifically tailored for ranking congeneric series based on deep 3D-convolutional neural networks. Furthermore we prove its effectiveness by blindly testing it on datasets provided by Janssen, Pfizer and Biogen totalling over 3246 ligands and 13 targets as well as several well-known openly available sets, representing one the largest evaluations ever performed. We also performed online learning simulations of lead optimization using the approach in a predictive manner obtaining significant advantage over experimental choice. We believe that the evaluation performed in this study is strong evidence of the usefulness of a modern deep learning model in lead optimization pipelines against more expensive simulation-based alternatives.},

  abstract = {Alchemical free energy calculations are a useful tool for predicting free energy differences associated with the transfer of molecules from one environment to another. The hallmark of these methods is the use of "bridging" potential energy functions representing \textbackslash emph\{alchemical\} intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data. In this paper, we review current best practices for several popular application domains of alchemical free energy calculations, including relative and absolute small molecule binding free energy calculations to biomolecular targets.},

            Alchemical free energy methods with molecular mechanics (MM) force fields are now widely used in the prioritization of small molecules for synthesis in structure-enabled drug discovery projects because of their ability to deliver 1\textendash 2 kcal mol
            -1
            accuracy in well-behaved protein-ligand systems. Surpassing this accuracy limit would significantly reduce the number of compounds that must be synthesized to achieve desired potencies and selectivities in drug design campaigns. However, MM force fields pose a challenge to achieving higher accuracy due to their inability to capture the intricate atomic interactions of the physical systems they model. A major limitation is the accuracy with which ligand intramolecular energetics\textemdash especially torsions\textemdash can be modeled, as poor modeling of torsional profiles and coupling with other valence degrees of freedom can have a significant impact on binding free energies. Here, we demonstrate how a new generation of hybrid machine learning / molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials can deliver significant accuracy improvements in modeling protein-ligand binding affinities. Using a nonequilibrium perturbation approach, we can correct a standard, GPU-accelerated MM alchemical free energy calculation in a simple post-processing step to efficiently recover ML/MM free energies and deliver a significant accuracy improvement with small additional computational effort. To demonstrate the utility of ML/MM free energy calculations, we apply this approach to a benchmark system for predicting kinase:inhibitor binding affinities\textemdash a congeneric ligand series for non-receptor tyrosine kinase TYK2 (Tyk2)\textemdash wherein state-of-the-art MM free energy calculations (with OPLS2.1) achieve inaccuracies of 0.93{$\pm$}0.12 kcal mol
            -1
            in predicting absolute binding free energies. Applying an ML/MM hybrid potential based on the ANI2x ML model and AMBER14SB/TIP3P with the OpenFF 1.0.0 (``Parsley'') small molecule force field as an MM model, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the error in absolute binding free energies from 0.97 [95\% CI: 0.68, 1.21] kcal mol
            -1
            (MM) to 0.47 [95\% CI: 0.31, 0.63] kcal mol
